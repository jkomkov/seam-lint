"""Witness kernel: deterministic measurement → receipt pipeline.

Layer A (measurement): Diagnostic — already exists in diagnostic.py
Layer B (binding):     WitnessReceipt — produced here
Layer C (judgment):    Disposition — resolved here from policy

The kernel is intentionally small and stateless. Given a Diagnostic
and a composition hash, it produces a WitnessReceipt with content-
addressable hashes. No network, no side effects, no policy opinions
beyond the disposition thresholds.
